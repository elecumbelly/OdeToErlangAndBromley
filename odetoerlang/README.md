## 🚀 Key Features

- **🏛️ Command Centre** - Unified executive dashboard for real-time operation health monitoring.
- **🧮 Advanced Math Engine** - Mathematically correct Erlang B, C, and A models.
- **🔄 Solve For Mode** - Inverse Erlang calculations (Fixed Headcount → Achieved Service Level).
- **📈 Historical Analysis** - Pattern detection and volume forecasting (Linear, Moving Avg, Smoothing).
- **⏰ Automated Scheduling** - AI-driven roster generation from staff availability and skill sets.
- **📱 Mobile Manager Mode** - Fully responsive UI with sticky KPI tracking for on-the-go planning.
- **📥 Universal Ingest** - Smart CSV column mapping for any ACD report format.

- **State:** Zustand (State Management)
- **Database:** `sql.js` (SQLite WASM) + `idb` (IndexedDB Persistence)
- **Engine:** Pure TypeScript implementation of Erlang A/B/C and Scheduling Algorithms
- **Test:** Vitest (500+ unit/integration tests)

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

- **Binary search agent solving:** O(log n) performance for large staff requirements.
- **Lazy Loading:** All tabs are code-split to ensure a fast initial bundle load.
- **Non-blocking DB init:** UI renders immediately while the SQLite engine hydrates.
- **Input Debouncing:** 300ms delay prevents UI jank during rapid parameter changes.

## 🛠️ Recent Changes (v0.2.2)
