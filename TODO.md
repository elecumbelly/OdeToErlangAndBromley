# TODO - OdeToErlangAndBromley

**Status:** Build/tests passing (500+), version 0.2.0. Major features shipped (calculator, scenarios/model comparison, capacity, historical/forecasting, workforce/BPO, simulation, import/export, tour, mobile sticky KPIs, DB backup).

**Open items:**
- Mobile polish pass (visual QA on all tabs).
- Optional E2E smoke (Playwright/Cypress) for core flows (calc, import/apply, export/DB backup).

Everything else tracked here has been delivered. Update this file only when new work is identified.
